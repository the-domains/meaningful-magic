On a cool day, an ordinary car can become dangerously hot. 

On hot day, it is absolutely deadly. 

Rook escapes 13 feet of chain, 6 locks, leather straps and ankle shackles as the interior of this car exceeds 140 degrees Fahrenheit. 

Imagine what it would be like for a defenseless dog or child. 

Please, do not try this!
