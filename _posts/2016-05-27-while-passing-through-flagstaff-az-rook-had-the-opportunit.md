While passing through Flagstaff, AZ, Rook had the opportunity to try a new escape upon which he was working. 

Here, he escapes a death row restraining belt, a large bag sealed with a truss rod and padlocks, and a body bag sealed with a lock with a combination chosen by a spectator (and unknown to Rook). 

Will he escape?

Please, do not try this!
